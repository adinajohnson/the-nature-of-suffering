# THE NATURE OF SUFFERING

A game about the Book of Job. Can be played at [itch.io](https://tremolomoon.itch.io/joban-game).

Built with [Phaser](http://phaser.io).

## Explanation

This was created for a college course on the book of Job in the Bible and various historical interpretations. We were given an option to replace a written reading response with a creative response. This game is a rumination on how difficult it can be for humankind to know what God wants and how to live a life that pleases God and gain success. This is a question raised across religions. For example, in a Babylonian work, The Poem of the Righteous Sufferer, the writer laments his misfortune but is confused as to what he has done to incur the wrath of the gods. There is also the possibility that God does not influence the lives of humans much at all, as some interpretations of God's speech in the whirlwind in the book of Job state. 

Thus, variables are randomized at the start of each game to simulate what God expects of His subjects and how much he is willing to reward or punish. These are hidden from the user, whose only feedback is how the events change and a brief ending, in which they are only told whether they have pleased God and whether He cares. Due to the randomization, however, they cannot carry this knowledge to the next playthrough (this also prevents only one view of God).

Despite this lengthy explanation, this is ultimately a small and silly game, and I hope you enjoy playing it.
